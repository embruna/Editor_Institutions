	abstract = {Purpose – The paper aims to put into context globalization as educational, economic, and technological relations, with attention to dimensions of variability and other problems associated with domination of western and northern post‐industrial developed nations on the developing world. Design/methodology/approach – The approach taken in this paper is that of a discussion of the issues. Findings – Education in its broadest functional terms prepares populaces for interaction within the social, economical, political, and cultural domains of daily life. Global education in its encompassing reach toward the macrocosm prepares populations in many countries to co‐exist, particularly with information age technological innovations. Such an overstatement or broad sweep of the maximum view of international education overlooks in‐depth understanding of the exercise of power in the international realm. Originality/value – The paper discusses the issues surrounding globalization, the economic gap between technologically trained workers and agrarian economies and the cultural divide caused by policies and assumptions.},

	abstract = {This book investigates the intensifying struggle for excellence between universities in a globalized academic field. The rise of the entrepreneurial university and academic capitalism are superimposing themselves on the competition of scientists for progress of knowledge and recognition by the scientific community. The result is a sharpening institutional stratification of the field. This stratification is produced and continuously reproduced by the intensified struggle for funds with the shrinking of block grants and the growing significance of competitive funding, as well as the increasing impact of international and national rankings on academic research and teaching. The increased allocation of funds on the basis of performance leads to overinvestment of resources at the small top and underinvestment for the broad mass of universities in the middle and lower ranks. There is a curvilinear inverted u-shaped relationship of investments and returns in terms of knowledge production. Paradoxically, the intrusion of the economic logic and measures of managerial controlling into the academic field imply increasing inefficiency in the allocation of resources to universities. The top institutions suffer from overinvestment, the rank-and-file institutions from underinvestment. The economic inefficiency is accompanied by a shrinking potential for renewal and open knowledge evolution.},

Nonetheless, diversity among scientists with respect to their journal quality perceptions plays an important role in hiring and promotion decisions. In this article we examine the degree of diversity within economics based on the journal quality perceptions of 2,103 AEA economists worldwide. Specifically, we empirically test for factors that might explain differences in an economist's journal quality perceptions. These factors include an economist's geographic origin, school of thought, journal affiliation, field of specialization and research orientation. Indeed, we find that a significant degree of diversity in journal quality perceptions exists between economists that belong in different subgroups. These results might explain the frequent debates in tenure and promotion committees where journal standings are used for the evaluation of a researcher's output.},

The crossed presence of scholars on editorial boards, the phenomenon called interlocking editorship, is considered a proxy of the similarity of editorial policies. The evidences support the idea that this group of journals is better described as a set of only relatively connected subfields. In particular two main subfields are identified, consisting of research oriented journals devoted respectively to LIS and MIS. The links between these two subsets are weak. Around these two subsets there are a lot of (relatively) isolated professional journals or journals characterized more by their subject-matter content than by their focus on information flows. It is possible to suggest that this configuration of the network may be the consequence of the youthfulness of Information Science \& Library Science, which has not permitted yet to reach a general consensus through scholars on research aims, methods and instruments.},

We draw from two major data sources: a series of cross-national surveys of IR faculty in thirty-two countries and a database of journal articles published in the twelve leading IR journals from 1980 to 2014. We find obvious signs of US hegemony and insularity. Other national IR communities are relatively open to foreign ideas, if not to hiring scholars trained in other countries. Finally, despite US hegemony in the discipline and pockets of geographic insularity, we see a diverse field characterized by a wide range of theoretical, methodological, and epistemological commitments. We conclude with a discussion on the sources and consequences of diversity in the international relations discipline.},

Moreover, we also make an exploratory analysis of the geographic, economics subfield and institutional concentration in 704 economics journals. An important finding of this paper is that specialized journals in the sample report the highest degree of author concentration. This result is quite similar to the findings by Cox and Chung (1991). Furthermore, there are several instances showing that the journals lean towards certain norms; this may affect the flow of innovative ideas into economics. We conclude that a knowledge activity, involving the high degree of concentration and a biased publication process, may affect the flow of new ideas into the discipline.},

Once the values were obtained, the journals were categorized according to each indicator and the ordinal positions were compared. Different profiles of journals are analyzed in connection with experts opinion, such as regional orientation, and the consensus among researchers is studied.

	abstract = {In academic communication, editors exert a significant influence on a journal’s mission and content. We examined how the composition of editorial board members, in particular diversity in terms of institution, is related to journal quality. Our sample comprised 6916 editors who were affiliated with 246 economics journals. Using Stirling Index of Diversity, we provided a single numeric index (DI) to measure the diversity of institutions which is composed of variety, balance, and disparity. Then we related it to journal quality, as reflected in three widely used indices in economics: the five-year impact factor, the association of business schools’ (ABS) journal quality guide, and the eigenfactors. The results show that academic journals in the field of economics are heavily dominated by US institutions, but in terms of geographic distribution, there are more institutions in Europe than in North America. Surprisingly, we found that the diversity of editorial board members in terms of institution is negatively related to ABS ranking, but unrelated to the five-year impact factor and the eigenfactors. While when we removed the US journals from the sample, there was a significant positive impact between institutional diversity and the five-year impact factor. Our study extends the scarce knowledge on the composition of editorial teams and their relevance to journal quality by study the correlation between the institutional diversity index and three different journal quality indices. The implication of this study is that more effort is needed to increase the diversity in the composition of editorial teams in order to ensure transparency and promote equity.},

	abstract = {The spread of ideas in the scientific community is often viewed as a competition, in which good ideas spread further because of greater intrinsic fitness, and publication venue and citation counts correlate with importance and impact. However, relatively little is known about how structural factors influence the spread of ideas, and specifically how where an idea originates might influence how it spreads. Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to faculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer science, and the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205 Ph.D.-granting departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and on the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and does facilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a mechanism, we then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models to simulate the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of where an idea originates on its longterm diffusion across the network. We find that research from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of similar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses establish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the quality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation. Our results establish faculty hiring as an underlying mechanism that drives the persistent epistemic advantage observed for elite institutions, and provide a theoretical lower bound for the impact of structural inequality in shaping the spread of ideas in science.},

The median Fortune 500 firm interlocked (shared directors) with seven other large firms during the mid-1980s, although this prevalence dropped slightly by the mid-1990s. In contrast to Japan, interlocks among American firms are rarely linked to banking relationships or vertical (buyer-supplier) relationships; rather, they reflect the embeddedness of corporate governance in social structures (e.g., friendship or other ties). Recent empirical research has linked interlocks to almost every important aspect of corporate governance, from executive compensation to strategies for takeovers and defending against takeovers. These findings suggest that proposals for reforming boards of directors through changing incentive structures (e.g., paying directors in equity rather than cash) are likely to have little effect because they misconstrue the role of the board as a social institution.},

	abstract = {Purpose Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the “systematic review” approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Due to the importance of academic journals, it is critical to understand how they can create influence on research fields. An alternative way to understand how scholarly journals create influence in academic fields is to analyze the editorial board interlockings (EBI) and how they may generate networks within academic fields. EBI is the term used to describe the general circumstance where the same scholar is a member of multiple editorial boards, which creates a social network dimension within and between academic journals. The aim of this paper is to examine EBI phenomenon within knowledge management and intellectual capital fields (KM–IC). Assuming that EBI creates a social structure within scholarly journals, this paper investigates how KM–IC journals are connected through EBI, which journals are the most influential within KM–IC field and identify if KM–IC scholarly journal network breaks into subgroups. Social network analysis was the method applied using data from KM–IC ranking. Results identified the scholarly journal network, the high influence journals, and the cohesive subgroups within KM–IC field.},

The successful transfer of wealth from one generation to the next is increasingly a central concern for the very wealthy. This article shows how the labor of women from elite and non-elite backgrounds enables and facilitates the accumulation of wealth by elite men. From covering “the home front” to investing heavily in their children’s future, and engaging non-elite women’s labor to help them, the elite women featured here reproduced not just their families, but their families as elites. Meanwhile, the affective and emotional labor of non-elite women is essential for maintaining the position of wealth elites while also locking those same women into the increasing inequality they help to reproduce.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Female faculty in agricultural sciences has increased from 12 to 23\% in the last 10 yr. Higher leadership positions within academia, industry, and government research positions are primarily held by men. The proportion of women with Ph.D. degrees in agricultural sciences is still higher than those with careers and leadership positions. Representation of women in agricultural science was 5\% in 1979, increasing to 12\% by 2005. The near equal numbers of women and men receiving Ph.D. degrees in agricultural science in 2012 (44 to 56\%, respectively) would suggest an upward trend of women scientists above 12\% should be occurring over time. To monitor possible trends in the representation of women in agricultural science, we quantified the numbers of women at land grant institutions at the faculty and higher administration level and in leadership positions within scientific societies, industry boards, and government research positions. The survey results showed that female faculty in the agricultural sciences increased from 12\% in 2005 to 23\% in 2014; however, female representation in leadership positions in academia were low, with department chairs (18\%), society leadership (18–36\% ranging across societies), and deans of colleges of agriculture (9 out of 50) lagging behind men. Similarly, the number of women on the executive boards of agricultural industries (11\%) and at the USDA-ARS (26\%) are still lower than the proportion of women with Ph.D.'s in agricultural sciences. These results suggest progress toward gender representation that reflects the number of qualified women at the faculty level, but it seems that representation is limited after the graduate training level, at the faculty level and beyond. We must be diligent in crop and soil sciences in mentoring female students and young faculty to ensure progress of female scientists to all levels of leadership in academia and the private and public sector.},

Both insisted that the only possible ethical action was one within the bounds of rational knowledge that was inherently authoritative, but this sat uneasily with their focus on the relation between concrete social authority and the authoritativeness of beliefs in the sociology of religion. In rejecting Comte's explicit avowal of the embodiment of moral authority in the secular priesthood of sociologist, Weber and Durkheim had to paper over the social authority supporting the formulation of this rational knowledge. Each then produced a sociology of knowledge without a well-specified mechanism, in turn encouraging the development of the sociology of knowledge as ct flawed sub-discipline.},

	abstract = {Despite substantial progress for women in science, women remain underrepresented in many aspects of the scholarly publication process. We examined how the gender diversity of editors and reviewers changed over time for six journals in ecology and evolution (2003–2015 for four journals, 2007–2015 or 2009–2015 for the other two), and how several aspects of the peer review process differed between female and male editors and reviewers. We found that for five of the six journals, women were either absent or very poorly represented as handling editors at the beginning of our dataset. The representation of women increased gradually and consistently, with women making up 29\% of the handling editors (averaged across journals) in 2015, similar to the representation of women as last authors on ecology papers (23\% in 2015) but lower than the proportion of women among all authors (31\%) and among members of the societies that own the journals (37\%–40\%). The proportion of women among reviewers has also gradually but consistently increased over time, reaching 27\% by 2015. Female editors invited more female reviewers than did male editors, and this difference increased with age of the editor. Men and women who were invited to review did not differ in whether they responded to the review invitation, but, of those that responded, women were slightly more likely to agree to review. In contrast, women were less likely than men to accept invitations to serve on journal editorial boards. Our analyses indicate that there has been progress in the representation of women as reviewers and editors in ecology and evolutionary biology, but women are still underrepresented among the gatekeepers of scholarly publishing relative to their representation among researchers.},

Method Survey of the country of origin of papers submitted to and published in six leading psychiatric journals over a 3-year period (1996{\textasciicircum}1998).
Results Only 6\% of the literature is published from regions of the world that account for over 90\% of global population. The three journals published in Europe had a significantly higher proportion of international articles when compared to the three American journals.Less than1\% of all published articles described mental health interventions in the RoW. Acceptance rates were significantly lower for papers submitted from the RoW.
Conclusions There is a gross underrepresentation of research from the RoW. This has implications for the development of a truly international psychiatry.},

After controlling for size, industry, and other corporate governance measures, we find significant positive relationships between the fraction of women or minorities on the board and firm value. We also find that the proportion of women and minorities on boards increases with firm size and board size, but decreases as the number of insiders increases.},

The outcome is diversity in the information on affiliation that may generate some degree of uncertainty in connection with institutional attribution when discrepancies arise between the information contained in the two fields, mainly when the only option available is the reprint address.

	abstract = {The board of directors is one of a number of internal governance mechanisms that are intended to ensure that the interests of shareholders and managers are closely aligned, and to discipline or remove ineffective management teams. Among the most signiﬁcant governance issues currently faced by the modern corporation are those relating to diversity, such as gender and age, and independence of directors. While board diversity and independence has been a growing area of research in recent years, most empirical research on this topic has been restricted to US data. The generalisability of such ﬁndings may not extend across national boundaries due to different regulatory and economic environments, cultural differences, the size of capital markets and the effectiveness of governance mechanisms. Consequently, the importance and value of various governance structures, including board diversity and independence, should be separately examined in each country, and the inﬂuential factors investigated. This study reports on the diversity and independence of the board membership of 100 top Australian companies in 2003. Australia has one of the most developed stock markets in the Asia-Paciﬁc region. With the collapse of several well-known public companies such as Ansett, OneTel and HIH, there is an increasing demand to evaluate the corporate governance practices of Australian companies, including the composition of boards. Accordingly, this research provides a timely review of the state of corporate governance in Australia so far as board composition is concerned.},

	volume = {99},
	abstract = {Purpose: Membership on a professional medical society or journal editorial board is a marker of influence and prestige for those in academic medicine. This study presents the first comprehensive quantification of women on these boards and the implications for women in medicine.
Methods: The numbers of women and men on professional society and journal editorial boards across 28 specialties (March 2004) were counted. The number of women holding multiple roles on these boards and the number of women holding top leadership positions on these boards were counted, and these proportions were compared.
Results: Three-thousand-four-hundred-seventy-three individuals on 39 professional medical society boards and 54 journal editoral boards were included. Eighty-three percent (2,884) of board members were male. Men occupied {\textgreater}80\%o of top leadership positions on these boards. Thirty-five of the 589 women in the study held multiple roles. Anesthesiology (p{\textless}0.0025), pediatrics (p{\textless}0.0001), dermatology (p=0.0001), obstetrics/ gynecology (p=0.05), medical genetics (p{\textless}0.015) and rehabilitation medicine (p{\textless}0.03) had significantly lower proportions of women on boards in comparson to the total women in the specialty. Internal medicine, plastic surgery, cardiology and general surgery had neady equivalent proporlions; in otolaryngology and family medicine, female board members slightly exceeded the proportion of women in the field.
Conclusion: Women's representation on society and editorial boards does not always reflect their presence in medical specialties, and it is critically lacking in certain specialties. Efforts should be made to attain parity of women leaders on these boards. Further efforts should be made to eliminate barrers to women's leadership in medicine.},

We use the Fama and French (1992, 1993) valuation framework to take the level of risk into consideration, when comparing firm performances, whereas previous studies used either raw stock returns or accounting ratios. Our results indicate that firms operating in complex environments do generate positive and significant abnormal returns when they have a high proportion of women officers. Although the participation of women as directors does not seem to make a difference in this regard, firms with a high proportion of women in both their management and governance systems generate enough value to keep up with normal stock-market returns. These findings tend to support the policies currently being discussed or implemented in some countries and organizations to foster the advancement of women in business.},

The people who perform this function have considerable power to shape the literature, and therefore form a worthwhile object of study. This paper considers the editorial review board of The Accounting Review at three points in time over a 20-year period.

	abstract = {Background: Although there has been a continuous increase in the number of women working in the ﬁeld of medicine, women rarely reach the highest academic positions as full professors or editorial board members.
Objective: We aimed to determine the proportion of women on the editorial boards of top-ranked medical journals in different medical specialties.
Methods: We analyzed the gender of editorial board members of 60 top-ranked journals of 12 Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Reports categories. A total of 4175 editors were included in our analysis.
Results: Only 15.9\% (10 of 63) editors-in-chief were female. In the 5 categories, critical care, anesthesiology, orthopedics, ophthalmology and radiology, nuclear medicine and medical imaging, currently not 1 woman holds the position of editor-in-chief. Less than one ﬁfth (17.5\%, 719 of 4112) of all editorial board members were women. There were signiﬁcant differences among the evaluated categories, with the highest percentage of women in the category of medicine, general and internal and the lowest in the category critical care, followed by orthopedics. In every category, the proportion of women as editorial board members was substantially lower than that of men.
Conclusions: Women are underrepresented on the editorial boards of major medical journals, although there is a great variability among the journals and categories analyzed. If more women are nominated to serve on editorial boards, they will be a visible sign of continuing progress and serve as important role models for young women contemplating a career in academic medicine.

Five of these groups were, in 2006, still family-controlled. We ﬁnd a positive relation between both the ratio of outside directors, and the degree of board interlocks, with ﬁrm return-on-assets. Outside busy directors turned out to be key drivers of improved ﬁrm performance. Appointments of outsiders are endogenous to ﬁrm ownership structure. Blockholder activism as well as contestability becomes an internal mechanism that improves director monitoring and ex-post ﬁrm valuation.},

The dramatically skewed production of management scholarship is both ethically problematic in terms of Anglo-American domination of leading journals and the exclusion of many developing regions, and anachronistic given the shift of global production away from the North Atlantic in recent years. This continuing neo-colonial domination of intellectual production underpins the inequitable organization of the global economy and specifically the disproportionate realisation of wealth in the global North at the expense of the global South.

The empirical analysis, based on a sample of 126 ﬁrms drawn from the S\&P500 group of companies over a 5-year period, suggests that board gender diversity (BGD) signiﬁcantly affects CSP. However, this impact depends on the social performance metric under investigation. In particular, more gender diverse boards exert stronger inﬂuence on CSP metrics focusing on ‘negative’ business practices, such as the ‘concerns’ dimension of the Kinder Lydenberg Domini, Inc. (KLD) ratings. This is because such CSP ratings have the potential to induce higher levels of ‘empathic caring’, which strongly appeals to female directors. Hence, this study reveals further hidden connections in the BGD–CSP link which have important implications for managers, nongovernmental organisations and socially responsible investors.},

We employ personal political contributions' data to measure political ideology distance among groups of inside, outside directors and the CEO. Our empirical evidence strongly supports the notion that outside directors' monitoring effectiveness is more likely to be enhanced when their viewpoints are distinct from those of management. We find that ideologically diverse boards are associated with better firm performance, lower agency costs and less insiders' discretionary power over the firm's Political Action Committee (PAC) spending. Taken together, our results lead us to conclude that multiplicity of standpoints in corporate boardrooms is imperative for board effectiveness.},

Importantly, externally-reviewed papers do not outperform editor-only reviewed published papers in terms of visibility within a 5-year citation window. These findings suggest that in many instances editors can be all that is needed to review papers (or at least conduct the critical first review to assess general suitability) if the purpose of peer review is to primarily filter and that journals can consider reducing the number of referees associated with reviewing ecology and evolution papers.},

Editorial board memberships are an important example of such positions; membership is both a professional honor in recognition of achievement and an opportunity for professional advancement. We surveyed 10 highly regarded journals in environmental biology, natural resource management, and plant sciences to quantify the number of women on their editorial boards and in positions of editorial leadership (i.e., Associate Editors and Editors-in-Chief) from 1985 to 2013. We found that during this time period only 16\% of subject editors were women, with more pronounced disparities in positions of editorial leadership. Although the trend was towards improvement over time, there was surprising variation between journals, including those with similar disciplinary foci. While demographic changes in academia may reduce these disparities over time, we argue journals should proactively strive for gender parity on their editorial boards. This will both increase the number of women afforded the opportunities and benefits that accompany board membership and increase the number of role models and potential mentors for early-career scientists and students.},

Thus, the question arises whether a heterogeneously or rather a homogenously composed board contributes to the efficiency of a company’s management and monitoring. Especially national and international regulators and standard setters consider board diversity to be associated with an increasing firm performance. Therefore, the economic impact of board diversity aspects needs to be investigated empirically. This study examines the relationship between diversity within management boards and corporate performance for the German two-tier system by presenting a comprehensive literature analysis as well as an empirical analysis based on 149 publicly listed German organizations for the financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Hence, management board diversity is characterized by attributes, such as gender, age, nationality and functionality. An analysis comparable to the one at hand including multiple dimensions for German companies has not been performed, yet. We mostly find negative effects of various board diversity characteristics on corporate performance, especially regarding age and national diversity. This may be due to the fact that great internationality on boards can decrease communication between board members and large age differences may alleviate decision-making processes.},

The case study considers a recent Italian law (Section 36 of Law Decree n. 201/2011) which prohibits ID for credit, insurance and ﬁnancial companies. The ID networks of the top-100 Italian listed companies and of the ﬁnancial companies in this same list are considered and compared with the analogous networks in the US. The US networks represent a benchmark given that in the US companies act under Section 8 of the Clayton Act that has banned ID since 1914. The effects on the ID networks of the new Italian law are simulated under two different interpretations of the law. If the law will be applied according to a narrow interpretation, the Italian ID network will rest substantially unaltered. However, if the law will be applied according to a broad interpretation, the ID network for ﬁnancial ﬁrms will be completely modiﬁed with a network conﬁguration very similar to the American benchmark.},

Using a panel of ﬁrms listed in the North American and UK stock markets, we ﬁnd that adding board directors from countries with diﬀerent levels of genetic diversity (either higher or lower) increases ﬁrm performance. This eﬀect prevails when we control for a number of cultural, institutional, ﬁrm-level, and board member characteristics, as well as for the nationality of the board of directors. To identify the relationship, we use—as instrumental variables for our diversity indices—the migratory distance from East Africa and the level of ultraviolet exposure in the directors’ country of nationality.},

We develop an institutional conﬁgurational approach to integrate this ‘siloed’ ﬁeld and explain CG patterns around the world. To do so, we draw on an inductive, theory-building methodology based on fuzzy-set logic to uncover the conﬁgurations across institutional actorcentred domains and their impact on CG patterns. Empirically, we explore the necessary and sufﬁcient causal conditions leading to different features of codes of good governance across 32 OECD countries. We generate propositions linking conﬁgurational institutional domains to code features. Our results show that a single institutional domain by itself is not sufﬁcient to explain CG outcomes, and that these domains need to be considered in conjunction, leading, in turn, to the identiﬁcation of four distinct conﬁgurational governance prototypes. Our study offers a comprehensive account of drivers of cross-national differences in CG and yields useful insights for managing and regulating governance.},

	abstract = {Although the broad ﬁeld of ecology and its role in understanding the distribution and diversity of life on earth is a central part of the natural sciences, there is currently no comprehensive ranking of academic institutions for this discipline, which has quadrupled in research volume and visibility over the past three decades. We assessed scholarly productivity in the ﬁeld of ecology for 316 North American academic institutions between the years 2000 and 2014. We present institutional rankings of productivity in terms of number of publications, number of citations, and Hirsch’s h index, a measure that integrates productivity and impact. For the top-ranked institutions, we also calculated hm, an h-based metric used to compare productivity across institutions of different sizes. In addition, we analyzed the effect of institution size on h index, publication rate, and number of citations. We found that scholarship in ecology is not signiﬁcantly different between public and private universities, and from institutions ranging in size from extremely large to relatively small. Many of the institutions in the “ecology top 20” are widely considered as being among North America’s elite schools. However, there are several smaller institutions that have very high research productivity and impact in ecology with an apparently very strong ecology faculty. Administrators, faculty, prospective faculty, and students use institutional rankings, along with other data, to make decisions about programs in which to invest or participate. Relative institutional strength in the ﬁeld of ecology, however, has not been previously measured, perhaps because faculty with expertise in ecology are often dispersed through multiple academic units of a university. Thus, our ﬁndings ﬁll an important gap for ecology as a discipline.},

Here we show that a profound geographical mismatch also exists among editors of 20 leading conservation science journals. Collectively, these journals had few or sometimes no editors from many of the most biodiverse countries. This geographic bias likely inﬂuences what papers and topics are published and highlighted, and hinders global conservation goals. Compared with other biases, it is relatively easy to address this mismatch through journal policies and practices to recruit editors from under-represented countries, perhaps helping to reduce other mismatches too. Recruiting more editors from biodiversity-rich countries could improve conservation science by (1) adding diversity of expertise and perspectives to editorial boards and (2) creating capacity and empowering conservation leaders in countries where eﬀective conservation is most needed.},

The results indicate a greater presence of men in editorial committees, with higher positions of responsibility and in higher quartile journals. In scientific production, there is an equality based on gender in the number of signatures and in the number of women and men as the first signatory, although women appear to a lesser extent as authors of the correspondence and present fewer signatures in journals located in the first quartiles. It can be concluded that there is a gender inequality with respect to the management positions of the journals but more equality in the production of papers.},

	abstract = {Peer-reviewed publication volume and caliber are widely-recognized proxies for academic merit, and a strong publication record is essential for academic success and advancement. However, recent work suggests that publication productivity for particular author groups may also be determined in part by implicit biases lurking in the publication pipeline. Here, we explore patterns of gender, geography, and institutional rank among authors, editorial board members, and handling editors in high-impact ecological publications during 2015 and 2016. A higher proportion of lead authors had female first names (33.9\%) than editorial board members (28.9\%), and the proportion of female first names among handling editors was even lower (21.1\%). Female editors disproportionately edited publications with female lead authors (40.3\% of publications with female lead authors were handled by female editors, though female editors handled only 34.4\% of all studied publications). Additionally, ecological authors and editors were overwhelmingly from countries in the G8, and high-ranking academic institutions accounted for a large portion of both the published work, and its editorship. Editors and lead authors with female names were typically affiliated with higher-ranking institutions than their male peers. This description of author and editor features provides a baseline for benchmarking future trends in the ecological publishing culture.},

Our evidence suggests that bank well-connectedness through indirect interlocks has a significant impact on financial stability. In particular, we find, in support of the extended resource-based view (RBV), that well-connected banks mitigate their credit and insolvency risks but, contrary to our expectation, lower bank capitalisation. Our evidence suggests that the Interlocks Act and bank governance reforms need to consider the role of professional communications among bank directors to fully achieve their intended goals.},

This article analyzes data collected from leading public administration journals in 2017 to investigate the role of women as gatekeepers of public administration knowledge. The data illustrate a clear underrepresentation of women on editorial boards. Drawing from these data, research on journal editorships, and feminist theory, the authors present a critique of the current state of public administration research and a discussion of a way forward. They conclude with a proposal for how all public administration scholars (junior, senior, men, and women), journal leadership, and academic departments can move toward increasing women’s representation in these important positions.},

However, this work left open the pre-doctoral origins of people producing this work, and therefore could not rule out the operation of a meritocracy. Utilizing the theoretical contributions of Bourdieu, this paper argues that elite institutions constitute a unique positioning of symbolic capital that favors a particular type of candidate over equally able others. Through systematic personnel movements into doctoral programs, elites within the discipline are able to reproduce. A study of faculty cultural capital acquired from previous matriculation at elite universities offers empirical support for these ideas. The results suggest that previous studies of concentration in academic accounting are set in motion because of this systematic selection process.},

	abstract = {The productivity and performance of men is generally rated more highly than that of women in controlled experiments, suggesting conscious or unconscious gender biases in assessment. The degree to which editors and reviewers of scholarly journals exhibit gender biases that influence outcomes of the peer‐review process remains uncertain due to substantial variation among studies. We test whether gender predicts the outcomes of editorial and peer review for {\textgreater}23,000 research manuscripts submitted to six journals in ecology and evolution from 2010 to 2015. Papers with female and male first authors were equally likely to be sent for peer review. However, papers with female first authors obtained, on average, slightly worse peer‐review scores and were more likely to be rejected after peer review, though the difference varied among journals. These gender differences appear to be partly due to differences in authorial roles. Papers for the which the first author deferred corresponding authorship to a coauthor (which women do more often than men) obtained significantly worse peer‐review scores and were less likely to get positive editorial decisions. Gender differences in corresponding authorship explained some of the gender differences in peer‐review scores and positive editorial decisions. In contrast to these observations on submitted manuscripts, gender differences in peer‐review outcomes were observed in a survey of {\textgreater}12,000 published manuscripts; women reported similar rates of rejection (from a prior journal) before eventual publication. After publication, papers with female authors were cited less often than those with male authors, though the differences are very small ({\textasciitilde}2\%). Our data do not allow us to test hypotheses about mechanisms underlying the gender discrepancies we observed, but strongly support the conclusion that papers authored by women have lower acceptance rates and are less well cited than are papers authored by men in ecology.},

For the journal Biological Conservation, editors reject about half of the manuscripts assigned to them (known as “desk reject”) before sending the remaining manuscripts out for review. Given the importance of the editor's role in the publication process we ask: how consistent are editors' decisions in Biological Conservation? To answer this question, in 2018 we asked 10 editors of the journal to evaluate 40 manuscripts that had been previously evaluated in 2017 as part of the regular review process. The editors did not know which manuscripts had been sent out for review (20 total) and which had been desk rejected (20 total) in 2017. We found that in 2018, agreement among editors was reasonable in their decisions, even when papers that editors were asked to evaluate fell outside their area of expertise, and decisions did not differ with editorial experience. Of the 40 manuscripts, at least seven editors agreed on the decisions for 73\% (29) of them. On average, for the 20 manuscripts sent out for review in 2017, 70\% of editors in 2018 agreed with the decisions to review them. For the 20 manuscripts that were desk rejected in 2017, on average 67\% of editors in 2018 agreed with the decisions to desk reject them. While variation in editors' decisions on manuscripts exists, most decisions are repeatable and reliable. The journal can potentially improve the reliability of the review process by encouraging discussion among editors and by providing more detailed guidelines to editors. We urge other journals to carry out similar evaluations of this important desk rejection process.},

The research employed editorial board and content analysis of ten leading journals of criminology and criminal law, selected because of their international involvement according to their own aims and scope’s description. Most of the ten journals were found to have low levels of international involvement, with high proportions of both Anglo-American authors and data, and Anglo-American membership of editorial boards. The editorial board analysis also revealed institutional links with journal boards and a network of overlapping membership between the editorial boards. This suggests the existence of networks of Anglo-American scholars who are naturally inclined to favour research that fits their worldview. Such networks create a hierarchy of knowledge that favours the one produced in the US and the UK and promotes the scientific success of Anglo-American scholars and contents. However, although the shadow of Anglo-American dominance continues to lie over the two fields, there is also evidence of increasing research and authorship diversity. Perhaps, we are entering a new era of research internationalism.},

We find that referee gender has no effect on the relative assessment of femaleversus male-authored papers, suggesting that any differential biases of male referees are negligible. To determine whether referees as a whole impose different standards for female authors, we compare citations for female and male-authored papers, holding constant referee evaluations and other characteristics. We find that female-authored papers receive about 25\% more citations than observably similar male-authored papers. Editors largely follow the referees, resulting in a 6 percentage point lower probability of a revise and resubmit verdict for femaleauthored papers relative to a citation-maximizing benchmark. In their desk rejection decisions, editors treat female authors more favorably, though they still impose a higher bar than would be implied by citation-maximization. We find no differences in the informativeness of female versus male referees, or in the weight that editors place on the recommendations of female versus male referees. We also find no differences in editorial delays for female versus male-authored papers.},

This article therefore focuses on selecting salient dimensions of difference (i.e. important dimensions of organizational action), setting the perimeter of the populations studied, dealing with outliers and choosing appropriate diversity measures. We highlight the careful steps that need to be taken to make comparisons across higher education systems meaningful and use European data to illustrate the consequences of particular choices.},

Within the US context, diversity is often hailed as a strength although research has found a consistent decline in institutional diversity for the last 40 years. This article uses data from 1989 to 2014 to compare the level of diversity present across American higher education. The article draws on institutional theory to understand how institutions change in respond to environmental pressures impacting institutional diversity. The findings demonstrate that institutional diversity has continued to decrease and demonstrates how institutional decisions impact overall diversity present in the system. To conclude, the article discusses the causes and potential concerns for national systems that experience decreased institutional diversity. An improved understanding of the current state of institutional diversity provides useful measures for evaluating national higher education systems and raises critical questions for the mission and activities of higher education institutions themselves.},

In this article, stakeholder analysis is put forward as a tool to assist universities in classifying stakeholders and determining stakeholder salience. Increasingly universities are expected to assume a third mission and to engage in interactions with industrial and regional partners. While incentive schemes and government programmes try to encourage universities to reach out more to external communities, some important barriers to such linkages still remain. To fulfil their obligation towards being a socially accountable institution and to prevent mission overload, universities will have to carefully select their stakeholders and identify the ‘right’ degree of differentiation. For the university, thinking in terms of partnerships with key stakeholders has important implications for its governance and accountability arrangements. For the future of the universities we foresee a change towards networked governance and arrangements to ensure accountability along the lines of corporate social responsibility. In order to further explore some of these concepts and to empirically investigate the tendencies suggested here, this article proposes an ambitious research agenda for tackling the emerging issues of governance, stakeholder management and higher education’s interaction with society.},

Authorship informs us about active scientists who contribute to the production and dissemination of new knowledge through journal articles, while editorial board membership tells us about leading scientists who have obtained scientific recognition within the scientific community. This study analyses by gender the composition of the editorial boards of 131 high-quality Spanish journals in all fields of science, the presence of men and women as authors in a selection of 36 journals, and the evolution of these aspects from 1998 to 2009. Female presence is lower than male presence in authorship, editorial board membership and editorship. The presence of female authors is slightly lower than the presence of women in the Spanish Higher Education sector and doubles female presence in editorial boards, which mirrors female presence in the highest academic rank. The gender gap tends to diminish over the years in most areas, especially in authorship and very slightly in editorial board membership. Large editorial boards and having a female editor-in-chief are positively correlated with women presence in editorial boards. The situation of women in Spanish science is further assessed in an international context analysing a selection of international reference journals. The usefulness of journal-based indicators to monitor the situation of men and women in science and to assess the success of policies oriented to enhance gender equality in science is finally discussed.},

In this paper, we examine the presence of men and women economists on the editorial boards of thirty-six Italian economics journals published since 1970 and analyze the gender distribution across different kinds of boards, roles, and fields. Because boards are hierarchically ordered, women work mostly in the lower positions, and the increase in women's participation has led only to more "editorial secretaries." Since men and women tend to have different scientific interests and men's standards of academic value prevail, women economists cannot build publication records as strong as those of their male colleagues, which, in turn, affects women's hiring, promotion, and wages, as well as the shape of the discipline.},

The social network created by the exchange of PhDs among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view. Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar findings are reported for history and political science. This alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies—e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity, the strong association between department size and prestige, and the long-term stability of prestige rankings—encountered in research that is based on the more conventional view.},

	abstract = {This study examines editorial appointment patterns in journals representing seven scientific disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, economics, psychology, political science, sociology. Social science editors-in-chief are more likely than physical and natural science editors-in-chief to employ “particularistic” criteria in the selection of editorial appointees. In the social sciences, Columbia and Harvard editors-in-chief are significantly more likely than editors-in-chief with other doctorates to select graduates from Columbia or Harvard when making editorial appointments. In the physical and natural sciences, editors-in-chief with doctorates from schools other than Columbia and Harvard are just as likely as Columbia and Harvard editors-in-chief to select editorial appointees with Columbia or Harvard doctorates.The findings suggest that since consensus on basic paradigms does not exist in the social sciences, positions of influence are awarded and achieved on much more “particularistic” criteria than those for the physical and natural sciences.},

	abstract = {Journals moderate knowledge activity in economics. The activity of publishing article in professional journal forms significant part of knowledge output. Output of economics articles has been growing over the time. We examine an important question: Is there any case of institutional or location concentration in knowledge production? This paper analyses concentration indicators specific to economics journals and explores link between publication process and concentration. The analysis of various concentration measures present evidence for institutional-geographic-area-author concentration in Knowledge production in Economics. High concentration levels indicate possibility of institutional lock-in. The literature provides evidence for myopic refereeing, editorial favouritism and the presence of 'lock-in' effect. The achievement in journal publication is influenced by factors like institutional affiliation, propitious circumstances etc. Discussion carried out in this paper hints the possibility of causal link between unfair process and unfair outcome.},

The share of pages published in these three journals that were authored by faculty at universities employing the most prolific publishers declined markedly around 1970. Possible explanations include the expanded use of double-blind refereeing, the establishment of editorial committees, and increased emphasis on publishing at a broader set of research colleges and universities.},

We analyze early-career publication histories of nearly 2,000 graduates from top 30 economics programs in the early 1990s. We find that students who work with QJE editors average significantly higher values over four common measures of general research productivity than otherwise similar students and that students of QJE editors average significantly more AER and QJE publications. We further find that both students of ReStat editors and students of Econometrica editors average statistically more ReStat articles. Our results appear to reject the argument that top journal editors exhibit undue favoritism in the publication process with regards to their former students.},
