p1: institutional affiliation matters in publishing, which is a critical element of professional advancement. Work in fields like econ has shown that\ldots{}

\citep{addisEditorialBoardsItalian2003}
\citep{hodgsonEditorsAuthorsEconomics1999}
p2: documenting institutional affiliations is an essential first step is assessing the potential for such impacts. Studies documenting such affiliations are rare in the natural sciences. Furthermore, most studies take a relatively short ``snapshot'', which makes it impossible to evaluate potential temporal trends in relation to increased awareness and the global expansion of the scholarship.

p3: What is known about editorial boards of EEC journals We used data on the institutional affiliations of over XXXX scientists to test the prediction that (i) the editorial boards of journals in ecology, evolution, and conservation would exhibit patterns of institutional dominance similar to those observed in other fields, but that (ii) this dominance would decrease overtime. However, we also predicted that (iii) increases in the institutional diversity of editorial boards would result from adding novel institutions in Europe and North America, and not from adding editors based at institutions in the Global South.
